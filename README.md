my portfolio website
For my portfolio website, i wanted to code something that was simple, but easy to navigate. I knew right off the bat that i was going 
to have a difficult time in this class because coding was something that was 100% new to me at the begining of the semester. I learned
alot though. I learned about VSCode, CSS, and HTML, three languages that i am now (i personally wouldnt say fluent), but definitely now familiar with.
Learning how to READ code is still a challenge for me. I have never been good with math, so seeing all of the code and understanding all
of the lingo was difficult for me, but definitely worth learning. Overall i would say i am not as happy as i would like with my portfolio
site, but this comes from my difficulty in the class. I have spent many hours outside of class working on my code and trying to code it to
my likings, but i think i would just need alot more practice if i were to code another portfolio site.
